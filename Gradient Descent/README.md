# Gradient Descent : Used to create best fit line in Linear Regression

### Tests_Score Dataset
> STAGE 0 : At initital stage, Cost_function(i.e Mean Square Error) is calculated and later we found intercept and slope at each point.
> 
> We can draw a line using those intercept and slope.
> 
> STAGE 1 : Now , We take baby steps by using Learning rate and partial derivatives of x,y values
> 
> After reaching the next step, we again calculate the cost_function. Also, the intercept and slope is also calculated.  
> 
> STAGE 2 : If the cost_function reaches the minima after all the baby steps, now we can find the intercept and slope at this point.
> 
> This will be considered as the final intercept and slope and draw a line which is the BEST FIT LINE as it has LOW mean_square_error.
