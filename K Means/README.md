# K Means
> It creates clusters by grouping. This is done by clustering using centroids of each group of datapoints.

> Model is created with number of clusters based on plotting the features in the dataset.

> Now minmaxscaler is used to rescale the values of the features to have better plot without any cluster variations in datapoints.

> If the k value is not specified or not identifiable, we can use elbow method where for every k value sse(sum_of_squarederrors) is found. At k point where the bend is present in see that will be the final k value for the dataset.
