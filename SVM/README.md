# SVM
> It creates Hyperplane between classes of data by considering maximum marginal distance of 2 supporting vectors. Later model is created with dataset and it can predict the input data into which classification does it belongs to.

> If the data is Non-linear, we can increase the dimensionality of data by using kernels.

> Also we can specify the C(i.e Errors after classifying) value manually and also the gamma (i.e Curvature of data) value manually.
